<h2><span class="small">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>The active period of the Texas Revolution
lasted from October 2, 1835, to April 22,
1836. The capture of General Santa Anna,
coupled with the decisive victory at San
Jacinto, ended, for all practical purposes,
the war with Mexico. Mexico would mount two
raids into Texas, each capturing San Antonio
temporarily. But never again did Mexico have
permanent control of any Texas territory
north of the Rio Grande. The Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed in 1848, finally
acknowledged Texas independence from Mexico.</p>

of the Texas Revolution is drawn from a
number of sources, but principally from the
three-volume <i>Handbook of Texas</i>. With few
exceptions, information about persons or
places is confined to the period from October
1835 through April 1836. Additional
information about the men who fought for and
against Texas independence can be found in
the <i>Handbook</i> and in the books listed in the
bibliography.</p>

<h2><span class="small"><i>The Texas Revolution</i></span></h2>
<p>The summer of 1835 was filled with
unrest. In June the colonists had discovered
that General Cos intended to use the military
to force Texan compliance with government
regulations. William B. Travis and a body
of some 50 men responded to this threat in
August by attacking and taking the fort at
Anahuac. The action, although universally
condemned by the Texans, strengthened Mexican
determination to bring a military
peace-keeping force to Texas.</p>
<p>Texans feared that rights and liberties
guaranteed by the Mexican Constitution of
1824 were threatened by this action and the
increasing centralization of the government
in Mexico. Mexican officials viewed Texan
opposition as a direct attack on Mexican
national honor, an insult to the government
which had generously allowed the colonists to
settle in Texas.</p>
<p>The arrival of Mexican troops in Texas
finally united the Texans in opposition to
Santa Anna&rsquo;s government. When Colonel
Ugartechea demanded that a cannon at Gonzales
be returned, the colonists refused. The
first battle of the Revolution took place.
The Mexican commander was forced to retreat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Gonzales fell on October 2; Goliad, on
October 10. James Bowie and William Barrett
Travis captured Espada and Concepcion
Missions in October. Fort Lipantitlan
surrendered in early November. Between
December 5 and December 10, after a
month-long siege, San Antonio was taken by
the Texas Army and the Mexican troops
remaining in Texas were forced to retreat to
Mexico. At year&rsquo;s end, no &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; troops
remained on Texas soil.</p>
<p>The battles of 1835 were fought mainly by
Texas settlers, men who had a vested interest
in defending Texas&rsquo; soil. By the end of the
year, however, they believed the war was
over, and they returned to their homes. The
1836 campaign would be conducted principally
with volunteers from the United States, a
weakness that would hamper the war effort
throughout the rest of the Revolution.</p>
<p>While the Texan army drove out the
Mexican forces, a &ldquo;Consultation&rdquo; of delegates
from each of the municipalities met to
determine how best to proceed. On November
7, they issued a declaration of causes for
taking up arms against Santa Anna. A vote of
33 to 15 favored the peace party: Texas
would fight to restore the Constitution of
1824 and to achieve separate statehood for
Texas within the Mexican confederation.</p>
<p>A government of sorts was set up by the
Consultation. It consisted of a governor,
council, and lieutenant governor. None of
the parties held sufficient executive or
legislative powers. Furthermore, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
governor, Henry Smith, favored complete
independence for Texas; a majority of the
council favored continuing as part of Mexico.
Within a month these parties were fighting
among themselves. Then, on January 10,
Governor Smith attempted to dismiss the
council; the council impeached Smith and
replaced him with Lt. Governor James W.
Robinson.</p>
<p>The split between Smith and the council
was caused by attempts to mount a Matamoros
Expedition&mdash;an ill-favored plan to take the
war outside of Texas and to keep U. S.
volunteers occupied. Although the Matamoros
Expedition never was organized, it drew off
supplies and volunteers desperately needed in
Texas, and it divided the political and
military leaders at a time when unified
action was essential.</p>
<p>As winter held Texas in its grip, Santa
Anna mounted a counterattack. Arriving in
San Antonio on February 23, he laid siege to
the Alamo, where 150 Texans attempted to buy
time for Texas. Only 32 volunteers from
Gonzales came to reinforce the men at the
Alamo. All were killed shortly after dawn on
March 6.</p>
<p>While the Alamo was besieged, Texans met
in Convention at Washington-on-the-Brazos.
On March 2, the Convention declared Texas
independence, and a Declaration to that
effect was signed the following day. Before
the meeting adjourned, a constitution was
drafted and an interim government set up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Texan reverses in the field continued.
Learning of the fall of the Alamo, Sam
Houston and the undermanned and untrained
Texas army began a hasty retreat eastward.</p>
<p>F. W. Johnson was attacked at San
Patricio on February 27, and only he and four
men survived. James Grant and his men were
surrounded and killed at Agua Dulce on March
2.</p>
<p>Refugio was attacked and Amon King and
the garrison were killed on March 16.
William Ward, who had been sent to relieve
King, was captured with his men on March 22.
They were marched to Goliad where they were
executed on March 27.</p>
<p>Fannin, who had failed to respond to
calls for help from the Alamo because he
lacked transport for his arms and supplies,
finally began a retreat on March 19. He and
his men were caught outside Goliad at Coleto.
After fighting off several attacks, Fannin
was finally forced to surrender on the
morning of the 20th. Returned to Goliad,
Fannin and his men awaited a decision about
their fate. Gen. Urrea favored treating them
as prisoners of war; Santa Anna demanded that
they be executed as pirates. Santa Anna
prevailed. His orders were carried out on
Palm Sunday, March 27.</p>
<p>Throughout April, the remaining Texas
troops fled to the east. While they
retreated, panic seized the colonists. The
Runaway Scrape saw hundreds of families take
to the roads fleeing from the oncoming
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Mexican army. Even the Texas government was
caught up in the frenzy as Santa Anna moved
steadily eastward. Indeed, the government
narrowly escaped being captured as its
members prepared to sail to Galveston.</p>
<p>Finally, on April 20, the Mexican and
Texan armies met at San Jacinto. A brief
skirmish was fought on April 20. Then, as
the afternoon shadows began to lengthen, on
April 21 the Texan army advanced against
Santa Anna&rsquo;s troops. What took place then
was a slaughter of the Mexican army, its men
taken by surprise, cut off from escape.</p>
<p>The Texan victory was completed the next
day when a poorly-dressed soldier was brought
in from the field. The prisoners&rsquo; reactions
soon revealed that this was, indeed,
President-General Antonio Lopez de Santa
Anna. For all practical purposes, the war
was at an end.</p>

<p class="revint"><b>Ad Interim Government</b>The last act of the
Convention of 1836
was to elect an interim government to
serve until the people of Texas could
ratify the Constitution and hold
regular elections. David G. Burnet
served as president; Lorenzo de Zavala,
vice-president. This government acted
from March 16 until October 16, 1836.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Agua Dulce, Battle of</b>Fought March 2,
1836. James
Grant&rsquo;s small body of men, a part of the
Matamoros Expedition, and troops
commanded by Jose Urrea met on a spot
some 26 miles from San Patricio. Grant
and most of his men were killed. Those
who escaped death either were made
prisoner by the Mexican army or were to
join Fannin&rsquo;s forces at Goliad, only to
be executed in the Goliad Massacre.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Alamo Mission</b>The Mission San Antonio de
Valero, known as the &ldquo;Alamo,&rdquo;
was used as a fort by the Mexican army
from 1821 until December 1835. After
a two-month siege, Texan troops took
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
over San Antonio on December 10, and
drove the Mexican army from the city.
Texan soldiers hastened to the Alamo on
February 23, 1836, as Santa Anna&rsquo;s army
entered San Antonio. After a 13-day
siege, the Mexican army succeeded in
taking the Alamo on March 6. None of the
187 Texan soldiers survived the battle
and its aftermath.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Almonte, Juan Nepumoceno</b>A colonel in the
Mexican Army,
Almonte accompanied Santa Anna as an
aide-de-camp. He was captured at San
Jacinto. Almonte&rsquo;s report to the Mexican
government in January 1834 alerted the
government to the possibility that Texas
might be taken from Mexico by force or by
diplomacy.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Anahuac</b>Angered over the arrest of Andrew
Briscoe, citizens of Anahuac, led
by William B. Travis, attacked the
garrison on June 29, 1835. Mexican
troops under Antonio Tenorio were forced
to surrender and were expelled on June
30. The action was condemned by most
Texans, and numerous communities sent in
protests to the Mexican government.
Mexico retaliated by sending military
forces under the command of General Cos
to Texas to quell any future
demonstrations.</p>

<p class="revint"><b>Archer, Branch Tanner</b>Before joining the
Consultation,
Archer participated in the capture of
Gonzales. He was the president of the
Consultation, and he was appointed by
that body to serve as one of three
commissioners to the United States,
empowered to secure men and money for the
war effort.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Austin, Stephen Fuller</b>His speech at
Brazoria on
September 8, 1835, encouraged the
colonists to seek independence from
Mexican rule. Austin was elected
commander-in-chief of the Volunteer Army
in the field, and, as such, directed the
operations of the Texan army before
Bexar. In November 1835, the
Consultation appointed him a Commissioner
to the United States, where he worked
throughout the remainder of the
Revolution, negotiating for men and money
to support the revolutionary forces.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Austin, William Tennant</b>At the beginning
of hostilities,
he sent supplies to the Texas army from
the mouth of the Brazos. He participated
in the siege of Bexar and later served as

in Texas before the
Revolution, Baker went into east Texas
with F. W. Johnson to recruit soldiers
for Texas in August 1835. Baker fought
in the battle of Gonzales and the Grass
Fight. He was elected captain of his
company on March 1, 1836. His command
prevented the Mexicans&rsquo; crossing the
Brazos during the Texas Army&rsquo;s retreat.
After burning San Felipe, he rejoined
Houston&rsquo;s army and was wounded in the
battle of San Jacinto. In that
engagement, Baker commanded Company D,
1st Regiment of the Texas Volunteers.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Barrett, Don Carlos</b>Barrett served as
president of the Mina
Committee of Safety and Correspondence
and represented that community at the
Consultation. Barrett was instrumental
in framing the Declaration of November 7,
1835. After the session, Barrett became
a member of the General Council. He was

Texas Army, but resigned because of ill
health shortly after Henry Smith&rsquo;s
impeachment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p class="revint"><b>Bean, Peter Ellis</b>Bean had served in the
Mexican wars for
independence from Spain, and, for that
reason, was regarded with suspicion by
the colonists. However, he is credited
with having kept the Indian tribes from
interfering with the Texan army
throughout the Revolution. Neither side
fully trusted him during the war.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Beason&rsquo;s Ferry</b>Crossing on the Colorado

also includes the municipality of Bexar
which eventually became Bexar county.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Benavides, Placido</b>Benavides organized a
band of Mexican
soldiers to fight for the Texan cause at
the outbreak of hostilities. In February
1836, he was with James Grant at the
battle of Agua Dulce Creek. Grant

news of Urrea&rsquo;s arrival to Fannin at
Goliad.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Bonham, James Butler</b>Bonham was
commissioned
a lieutenant of cavalry on December 20,

1835. He arrived at the Alamo some time
between January 18 and 23, possibly with
James Bowie. At the beginning of Santa
Anna&rsquo;s siege, Travis sent Bonham to
Goliad to request reinforcements from
Fannin. On Bonham&rsquo;s return, he was sent
to Goliad and Gonzales to raise
volunteers. In spite of the danger,
Bonham forced his way back into the Alamo
on March 3 and died there on March 6.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Borden, Gail Jr.</b>Borden published the

before Santa Anna&rsquo;s advance.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Borden, John P.</b>Borden fought under
Collinsworth at Goliad,
October 7, 1835. Along with five other
men, he signed a protest addressed to S.
F. Austin, demanding that the men of
Goliad be allowed to choose their own
commander. He served under Dimmitt, but
was discharged January 11. He rejoined
the army on February 29, and, as a member
of Moseley Baker&rsquo;s company, he fought in
the battle of San Jacinto.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Bowie, James</b>A leader in the battle of
Concepcion and the Grass
Fight, Bowie also participated in the
siege of Bexar and the surrender of
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
General Cos. He commanded the volunteer
forces in San Antonio when William B.
Travis arrived with regular army troops.
After James C. Neill left the San Antonio
on February 14, 1836, Bowie and Travis
shared command of the army: Travis in
charge of the regular forces; Bowie, of
the volunteers. He was stricken with
&ldquo;typhoid pneumonia&rdquo; on February 24 and
remained confined to his cot throughout
the siege and fall of the Alamo.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Bowles, Chief (The Bowl)</b>Chief of the
Cherokee tribes
in East Texas, Bowles was reported to
have accepted a Mexican commission during
the Revolution. However, he signed a
treaty of peace with the Texas government
on February 23, 1836, and the war ran its
course with no organized Indian
interference.</p>
<p class="revint"><b><i>Bravo</i></b>A Mexican war vessel blockading the
Texas coast in early November, the
<i>Bravo</i> participated in the capture of the
American ship, the <i>Hannah Elizabeth</i>. The
<i>Bravo</i>, with two other Mexican ships, fought
an engagement with the Texan man-of-war
<i>Independence</i> in April 1836.</p>
<p class="bq">Another ship, formerly called the
<i>Montezuma</i> but rechristened the <i>Bravo</i> was
engaged in battle by the <i>Invincible</i>,
commanded by Captain Jeremiah Brown. The
battle took place at the mouth of the Rio
Grande, about 35 miles from Matamoros.
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
The <i>Bravo</i> grounded and was crippled by a
broadside fired from the <i>Invincible</i>.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Brazoria</b>Most men from Brazoria had
joined the Texan army at the
outbreak of the war. Nearly all of the
remaining population had fled in the
Runaway Scrape when Jose Urrea burned the
town on April 22, 1836.</p>
<p class="revint"><b><i>Brutus</i></b>The <i>Brutus</i> was bought and equipped
as a privateer by Augustus C. and
John K. Allen. The brothers sold the
ship to the Texas Navy on January 25,
1836. The ship did not see action in the
war, however.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Bryan, Moses Austin</b>While Stephen F.
Austin commanded the
Texan volunteers in the field, Bryan
served as his secretary. After Austin&rsquo;s
retirement from the army, Bryan joined
the army as private and fought in Moseley

as purchasing agent for the revolutionary
government.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Buffalo Bayou</b>This stream flows east from
Fort Bend County to the San
Jacinto River. On April 20, 1836, Sam
Houston&rsquo;s army crossed the San Jacinto
River at Lynch&rsquo;s Ferry and camped on the
south bank of Buffalo Bayou. On April
21, the battle of San Jacinto was fought
on its banks, near the point where the

<p class="revint"><b>Burleson, Edward</b>At Gonzales, on October
10, 1835, Burleson was
elected colonel of the only regiment
raised under Stephen F. Austin&rsquo;s command.
He succeeded Austin in the command of the
volunteer army in November. On December
3, Burleson was forced to order a
withdrawal of the army to Goliad, but
Milam&rsquo;s support of an advance against
Bexar countermanded that move. On
December 18, Burleson succeeded Philip
Sublett as colonel of infantry. At San
Jacinto he commanded the 1st Regiment of
Texas Volunteers.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Burnam&rsquo;s Ferry</b>Also spelled &ldquo;Burnham&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
the ferry was at the La
Bahia Road crossing of the Colorado
River. Sam Houston&rsquo;s army crossed the
river at this point on March 17, 1836.

<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">C</span></h2>
<p class="revint"><b>Centralists</b>A Mexican political party
which supported a strong
central government (instead of a federal
system). Although Santa Anna had
originally gained the presidency of
Mexico by supporting the federal cause,
he had decided in 1834 that Mexico was
not yet ready for democracy. He
dissolved the state legislatures in
October 1835, putting the nation under a
single, central governing body.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Chambers, Thomas Jefferson</b>Chambers took
an active part
in the events leading to the Revolution.
He offered his land for security to raise
men and money for the war. The

<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
to the United States to secure
volunteers and munitions.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Childress, George Campbell</b>Childress was
elected a
delegate to the Convention of 1836
shortly after he arrived in Texas.
There, he called the assembly to order

write a declaration of independence. The
document reported out by the committee
was written by Childress.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Coleto, Battle of</b>Fought March 19-20,
1836, this battle was
the culmination of the Goliad campaign.
James W. Fannin and some 400 men from
Goliad were falling back toward Guadalupe
Victoria when they were attacked by
Urrea&rsquo;s men near Coleto Creek. Although
the Texans countered three attacks, they
were forced to surrender when their water
supplies ran out and Urrea&rsquo;s main army

company of 52 men from Matagorda, and,
along with additional troops under Ben
Milam, took Goliad on October 9, 1835.
He was in command at Goliad until
November 18. The General Council
appointed him collector of customs for
the port of Matagorda on December 10,
1835.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p class="revint"><b>Collinsworth, James</b>The General Council
elected Collinsworth
captain of the Texas Regiment of Infantry

commander-in-chief. In the army, he
assisted the families fleeing in the
Runaway Scrape. He was made a major and
appointed an aide-de-camp to Houston on
April 8. His conduct in the battle of
San Jacinto was commended by both Houston
and Thomas J. Rusk in their reports.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Committee on Military Affairs</b>Created by
the General
Council, the Committee on Military
Affairs, through its recommendations and
its immediate supervision of military
matters, did much to influence the
conduct of the war from November 1835
through January 1836. Its members
included Wyatt Hanks, J. D. Clements, and
R. R. Royal.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Committees of Safety and Correspondence</b>On
May 8, 1835,
Mina organized a
Committee of Safety and Correspondence,
and Gonzales and Viesca followed suit a
few days later. By the end of the
summer, most communities in Texas had
such organizations. Their purpose was to
keep people in touch with developments
that affected the Revolution.</p>

<p class="revint"><b>Concepcion, Battle of</b>James Bowie and
James W. Fannin,
with a detachment of 90 men were scouting
for a secure campground when, on October
28, they were attacked by a Mexican
cavalry force about a mile from
Concepcion Mission. The battle lasted
some thirty minutes, ending when the main
body of the Texan army joined the fight.
The army took over the mission grounds
for a campsite.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Consultation</b>Called for October 16, 1836,
at San Felipe de Austin, the
Consultation failed to convene a quorum
until November 3. Although sharply
divided between the &ldquo;war hawks&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;peace doves,&rdquo; the body issued its
&ldquo;Declaration of November 7, 1835,&rdquo;
stating that the war&rsquo;s aim was to restore
the Mexican Constitution of 1824 and to
make Texas an independent state within
the Mexican Confederation. Sam Houston
was made commander-in-chief of the
regular army, a government was set up,
authorized by the Organic Law, and three
commissioners were sent to the United
States to seek money and soldiers. The
Consultation adjourned on November 14.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Convention of 1836</b>The General Council,
over Governor Smith&rsquo;s
veto, called for a Convention to assemble
at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1,
1836. The Convention adopted a

Anna&rsquo;s brother-in-law,
sent to Texas in September 1835
to investigate the colonists&rsquo; refusal to
pay duties at Anahuac. Cos landed 500
men at Matagorda Bay and then established
headquarters at San Antonio. He intended
to expel all who had come to Texas since
1830 and anyone opposed to Santa Anna.
Forced to surrender San Antonio on
December 10, Cos and his men were allowed
to return to Mexico on their pledge never
to take up arms against Texas again.
However, Cos returned, commanding a
column at the assault on the Alamo. He
crossed Vince&rsquo;s Bridge with
reinforcements for Santa Anna just before
Deaf Smith destroyed the bridge on April
21, 1836. He was captured after the
battle of San Jacinto.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Crockett, David</b>He came to Texas &ldquo;to
fight for his rights.&rdquo;
Crockett and some of his &ldquo;Tennessee boys&rdquo;
joined William B. Travis at the Alamo,
where he and his men were killed.
Contemporary reports from both Texan and
Mexican sources claim that Crockett
survived the assault on the Alamo, only
to be executed on Santa Anna&rsquo;s order.</p>

<p class="revint"><b>Cuellar, Jesus &ldquo;Comanche&rdquo;</b>Cuellar served
as a guide for
Ugartechea in November 1835 and fought
under Cos during the siege of Bexar. He
deserted the Mexican forces, reported to
Edward Burleson the weaknesses in the
defenses, and guided the Texans into San
Antonio. He joined James Grant for the
proposed Matamoros Expedition, but
attached himself to James W. Fannin&rsquo;s
command at Goliad. He devised a plan for
defeating Urrea&rsquo;s army, but Fannin was
unable to put it into effect. Cuellar
was sent to Refugio to warn Ward of
Mexican army operations, and from there
he joined the Texas Army.</p>

<p class="revint"><b>de Zavala, Lorenzo</b>A prominent Mexican
Federalist and a Texas
empresario, de Zavala moved his family to
a home on Buffalo Bayou in December 1835.
He supported the colonists in both their
attempt to restore the Constitution
of 1824 and in their later move for
independence. He represented Harrisburg
in the Consultation and in the Convention
of 1836. He was elected interim vice

some restrictions on land speculation by
Anglo American settlers and to reward

Espada Mission. Fannin was offered the
position of Inspector General of the
Texan forces by the General Council, but
he took, instead, an honorable discharge
on November 22, 1835. He then spent time
campaigning for a larger army. On
December 7, Sam Houston commissioned
Fannin a colonel in the regular army; on
December 10, the General Council ordered
him to enlist reinforcements and contract
for war supplies. As agent for the
government, Fannin began recruiting
forces for the proposed Matamoros
Expedition on January 9. He was elected
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
colonel of the Provisional Regiment of
Volunteers at Goliad on February 7, and
he acted as commander-in-chief of the
army from February 12 to March 12, 1836.
Learning that Urrea had occupied
Matamoros, Fannin and his men fell back
on Goliad and began fortifying the city.
Ordered to relieve William B. Travis at
the Alamo, Fannin made a short-lived
effort to transport supplies and
ammunition. When the transport wagons
broke down, the soldiers voted to return
to Goliad. After the fall of the Alamo,
Houston ordered Fannin to retreat to
Guadalupe Victoria. Fannin delayed,
however, staying in Goliad until March
19. Urrea&rsquo;s forces surrounded Fannin&rsquo;s
troops at Coleto Creek, and, after two
days of pitched fighting, Fannin was
forced to surrender. He and his men were
executed at Goliad on March 27.</p>

previously legislated limitations on the

<p class="revint"><b>Goliad</b>Formerly called La Bahia, Goliad
was a major point of military
operations in both 1835 and 1836. Texans
captured Goliad on October 9, 1835.
Supplies captured in this battle allowed
Stephen F. Austin and his men to carry on
the siege of Bexar. James W. Fannin
marched his command to Goliad and set up
headquarters near the presidio. He
remained committed to the defense of
Goliad, seeing it as the most suitable
location for a supply depot for the Texan
forces in the field. James B. Bonham&rsquo;s
arrival from the Alamo, requesting men
and supplies to relieve William B.
Travis, caused Fannin to attempt a rescue
mission. The effort failed, and Fannin
remained at Goliad until March 19. As
Urrea&rsquo;s forces neared Goliad, they fought
a number of skirmishes with troops under
the command of Johnson, Ward, King, and
Grant. The survivors of these conflicts&mdash;when

the document was sent to the General
Council. It arrived just as the
government was deep in negotiations with
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
sympathetic Federalists. The Declaration
did not have any immediate effect on the
Texan&rsquo;s conduct of the war or their
reasons for fighting. It did, however,
alienate popular Mexican support for the
Texan cause.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Goliad Massacre</b>James W. Fannin&rsquo;s men
captured at Coleto along
with survivors of units commanded by
Ward and Grant were returned to Goliad
after the battle of Coleto. When Fannin
surrendered, he understood that the men
would be treated as prisoners of war, and
Urrea did request that the prisoners be
so regarded. The Mexican government,
however, had passed the Black Decrees.
Anyone taking up arms against the Mexican
government was to be considered a pirate
and was subject to immediate execution.
Santa Anna wrote back ordering immediate
execution, and he backed that order up
with a similar one to Nicolas de la Portilla,
the commander at Goliad. On Palm Sunday,
March 27, 1836 unwounded Texans were
divided into three columns and were
marched down three roads to points about
a half mile outside Goliad. Ordered to
halt, the men were cut down by firing
squads. Men from two of the columns,
halted near wooded areas, were able to
make an escape and to carry the news of

four miles above
Gonzales, the battle took place on

demanded the city surrender its cannon,
the colonists refused. They buried the
cannon in George W. Davis&rsquo;s peach orchard
on September 29. When the men under
Francisco Castaneda marched on the town,
the colonists dug up the cannon, mounted
it, and fired the first shot of the

cannon was taken prisoner, it stopped
west of the Guadalupe.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Gonzales, Jose Maria</b>A federalist

Gonzales issued a proclamation calling on
Mexicans to support the Texan cause and

January, he led a force against the
Mexican town of Mier. Urrea marched to
intercept the army, and, although he

1835. His ill treatment by Phillip
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
Dimmitt led Viesca to protest to Texan
leaders, particularly to Stephen F.
Austin. The affair at Goliad threatened
to upset all Mexican support for the
revolution.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Vince&rsquo;s Bridge</b>Crossing Vince&rsquo;s Bayou,
the bridge was the only
viable crossing at that point on the San
Jacinto River. Erastus (Deaf) Smith
secretly destroyed the bridge on the
morning of April 21, at Houston&rsquo;s orders,
and all retreat for either Texan or
Mexican army was cut off.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">W</span></h2>
<p class="revint"><b>Ward, Thomas William</b>Ward joined the New
Orleans Greys in
1835 and was at the siege of Bexar. On
the day Milam was killed, Ward&rsquo;s right
leg was shot off by cannon fire. He
returned to New Orleans and recruited a
company of volunteers.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Ward, William</b>Ward helped recruit and
defray the travel expenses
of the Georgia Battalion of volunteers.
On December 20, 1835, he reported to
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
Henry Smith and was elected major of the
battalion when it was mustered into Texas
service. Ward was elected lieutenant
colonel after James W. Fannin reorganized
the battalion at Goliad. He was sent to
relieve Amon B. King at Refugio on March
13. Encountering the Mexican army
commanded by Urrea, Ward joined King in
the mission. After battling Urrea on
March 14, Ward and his men escaped on
March 15. They were overtaken on March
22, as they retreated toward Dimmitt&rsquo;s
Landing. Returned to Goliad, Ward and
his men were executed on March 27.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Washington-on-the-Brazos</b>The General
Council of the
Provisional Government and the Convention
of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos.
By March 20, the town was evacuated as
the interim government retreated to
Harrisburg.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Westover, Ira</b>Westover led a group of men
to join the force
assaulting Goliad in October 1835. He
remained at Goliad and was its first
adjutant. He commanded the successful
expedition against Lipantitlan in
November. Although praised by Austin and
the General Council for this action,
Westover was relieved of duty by Philip
Dimmitt. He became a member of the
General Council&rsquo;s committee on naval
affairs. On December 6, Westover was
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
made captain of artillery, resigning on
December 17. Recommissioned by the
Convention of 1836, he recruited a
company from Refugio and San Patricio.
It was the only regular army unit under
James W. Fannin&rsquo;s command. Westover and
his men were killed in the Goliad
Massacre, March 27.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Wharton, William Harris</b>Active in the
independence
movement, Wharton was one of the leaders
of the war party in Texas. He became
judge advocate of the army and served at
the siege of Bexar. He was appointed a
Commissioner to the United States in
November 1835, and served in that
capacity throughout the war.</p>
<p class="revint"><b><i>William Robbins</i></b>Purchased from McKinney,
Williams and Company for
$3,500 by the Texas government, this
schooner was renamed the <i>Liberty</i> in
January 1836. Before its purchase, it
had been used by William Hurd as a
privateer against the Mexicans.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Williamson, Robert McAlpin (Three-Legged Willie)</b>Crippled by
illness in his
childhood, Williamson nevertheless took
active part in the war. He was a
delegate from Mina to the Consultation
and was commissioned a major by the
provisional government on November 19,
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
1835. He was ordered to raise a corps of
rangers. At the battle of San Jacinto,
he served in William H. Smith&rsquo;s cavalry
company.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Woll, Adrian</b>Woll was Quartermaster
General in Santa Anna&rsquo;s
army. General Filisola sent him to the
San Jacinto battlefield to find out the
results of the engagement on April 21.
Woll was captured and held prisoner
throughout the peace negotiations.</p>
<p class="revint"><b>Wyatt, Peyton S.</b>Wyatt brought the
Huntsville Volunteers
from Alabama in 1835. The unit was
mustered into the Texas army on December
25 and sent to relieve Phillip Dimmitt&rsquo;s
company at Goliad. Because Wyatt had
been sent to Alabama on a recruiting
mission, he escaped death in the Goliad
Massacre.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">Y</span></h2>
<p class="revint"><b><i>Yellow Stone</i></b>The steamboat <i>Yellow Stone</i>,
purchased by McKinney and
Williams and registered to Toby and
Brother Company in New Orleans,
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
transported the Mobile Greys to Texas on
December 31, 1835. In February, Captain
J. E. Ross took the <i>Yellow Stone</i> up the
Brazos to San Felipe. It anchored later
at Groce&rsquo;s Landing, and General Houston
commandeered the boat to transport his
men across the river. The steamboat
continued down the Brazos, narrowly
escaping capture by the Mexican army at
Fort Bend. It transported a load of
supplies and muskets to Galveston on
April 25, then picked up the government
to take it to the San Jacinto battlefield
on May 4.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
